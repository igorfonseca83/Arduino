# Arduino UNO Mini-Weather Station

This is the first generation of my Arduino based mini-weather station with wi-fi connection, which is able to post data publicly online using ThingSpeak platform.

The weather station collects the following data related to the weather and environment using different sensors:

Temperature;
Humidity;
Atmospheric pressure;
Light intensity;
UV index;
Dust concentration.
The aim is to make a small and simple weather station, using open hardware.

No specific tools are required for the assembly of this project. All the components can be found online.

The circuit is powered by the USB port (connected to a computer or a ordinary phone charger), but you may also add an external DC power supply or a battery connected to the Arduino power jack.

A case for the weather station circuit was not developed yet.
